#### Title:
Using Databases to Study The World's Top Goalscorers

#### Subject and basis of questions in your work:
I will be building a database that contains all of the goal-scoring information for each player in the top 5 soccer leagues in the world. The specific leagues in question are the Premier League in England, Ligue 1 in France, the Bundesliga in Germany, Serie A in Italy, and La Liga in Spain. These teams have dominated european soccer for decades and contain the vast majority of elite players in the entire world. Studying these leagues will give me better insight then studying any others. A few questions that I specifically want to ask and answer are:

- What advanced metrics are most common in elite goal scorers?
- What advanced metrics that are not direct goal contributions (goals, assists, major stats such as these) contribute to an elite goal socers success? 
- What are some stand-out metrics that are unique to individual goal scorers? 
- Are there specific offensive stats that most elite goal scorers tend to not be elite in? For example, maybe the data shows most of the top scorers score less in away games or vice versa.
- Do the amount of goals their team conceded in games they played in seem to correlate to how many they score? Does a team's performance affect their individual performance?

These questions can all be discussed and explained using real examples, as I am a big soccer fan and can make the more advanced metrics easier to digest. I will be completing this project with SQLite.

#### Steps I have taken already:
I currently have all of the data organized uniformly so that there are no errors in the building process, as I will use import statements to make the build much simpler. 


#### Steps that I will take:
I will now begin working on the builder file and writing meaningful queries. I will use import statements in order to reduce the hassle of individually adding the data. The csv's are also quite large, so I may end up using individual insert statements anyways, but I'd like to avoid that as much as possible
