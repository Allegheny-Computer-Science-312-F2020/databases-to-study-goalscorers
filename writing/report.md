### Title: Using Databases to Study The World's Top Goalscorers

#### Data set
TODO 

#### Project Overview
This research project uses databases to study the soccer world's top goalscorers.  A few questions that I specifically wanted to ask and answer are:

- What advanced metrics are most common in elite goal scorers?
- What advanced metrics that are not direct goal contributions (goals, assists, major stats such as these) contribute to an elite goal socers success? 
- What are some stand-out metrics that are unique to individual goal scorers? 
- Are there specific offensive stats that most elite goal scorers tend to not be elite in? For example, maybe the data shows most of the top scorers score less in away games or vice versa.
- Do the amount of goals their team conceded in games they played in seem to correlate to how many they score? Does a team's performance affect their individual performance?

##### Motivation
In order to be enthusiastic about the actualy results of the research I performed, I tried to tie pick an field that was genuinely interesting to me. I am a big sports fan, and the world's most elite soccer leagues, commonly referred to as the "Top 5", got underway just under 2 months ago. The top 5 leagues are the Premier League in England, Ligue 1 in France, the Bundesliga in Germany, Serie A in Italy, and La Liga in Spain. These teams have dominated european soccer for decades and contain the vast majority of elite players in the entire world. Studying these leagues will give me better insight about the best goalscorers more than any others. There are a few other popular leagues, but none that contain the amount of elite players as the Top 5.
